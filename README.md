## Project Overview

Hodge's Hounds was a project created to help a family member who was considering opening a dog grooming business. I designed it with their needs in mind, creating an interactive login for them to be able to modify some of the information displayed dynamically from their end, without my help. I created a small Firebase Firestore database to hold this information, plus a login though Firebase too. The website was built using React.

## User stories

1) Users should be able to find outbackground informations about the business and the owner (about/homepage)
2) They should be able to navigate to the website that delivered the business owner's qualification.
3) They should be able to navigate to social media pages (not currently implemented since family member changed their mind about going into business, I had no links.)
4) View pricing and services, and general information about walking/grooming services.
5) Find contact information and location, with a map and a pin where the business is located for easy localisation. 
6) The business owner should be able to change prices/services on the website from the front-end, through a hidden login page that would allow them to access those functionalities.
